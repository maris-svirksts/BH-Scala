From north, you'll hit Bodes before the turn off.)  From Bodes, turn left out of the parking lot, and go about 3.5 miles on 84 until you get to Rt 554.  (And obviously if you don\u2019t go to Bodes first, just turn right at 554 from 84). This intersection has Mamacita\u2019s Pizza on your left as you turn (the only possible way).  Go about half a mile on 554, over a bridge at the Chama River, and then make the very next possible right turn on Rt 142 after bridge. You\u2019ll drive through a little wash (dry) and go maybe 1\/2 mile more to Trigger Rd.  It\u2019s after Inez St, and Green Meadows Dr.  Turn left on Trigger (the only way).  The address is 10 Trigger Dr.  \r\n\r\nWhen you head down Trigger you'll pass a house on the right and then you'll  come to a large painted sign that says \"11 Trigger\" with an arrow pointing straight ahead.

You may want to go to Bodes first and get food and drink, though it is a little past the turnoff to the house, assuming you are coming from the south or east or even probably the west. From north, you'll hit Bodes before the turn off.)  From Bodes, turn left out of the parking lot, and go about 3.5 miles on 84 until you get to Rt 554.  (And obviously if you don\u2019t go to Bodes first, just turn right at 554 from 84). This intersection has Mamacita\u2019s Pizza on your left as you turn (the only possible way).  Go about half a mile on 554, over a bridge at the Chama River, and then make the very next possible right turn on Rt 142 after bridge. You\u2019ll drive through a little wash (dry) and go maybe 1\/2 mile more to Trigger Rd.  It\u2019s after Inez St, and Green Meadows Dr.  Turn left on Trigger (the only way).  The address is 10 Trigger Dr.  \r\n\r\nWhen you head down Trigger you'll pass a house on the right and then you'll  come to a large painted sign that says \"11 Trigger\" with an arrow pointing straight ahead. At just about exactly where the sign is, you'll veer right at the fork. You'll see a more modest (but at least equally artful!) sign that says \"10 Trigger\" also with a pointer to the right. You should be able to see the house from here. Keep going and Casa Tocaya is the largest of 3 structures ahead. (On the right is an adobe shed, and on the left is the guest house.)\r\n\r\nGPS: I use Waze and the exact address doesn\u2019t come up, but you can set it for just Trigger Dr and that does come up, though it says it\u2019s in Medanales, NM instead of Abiquiu, NM. (The line between the two towns must be right there.) But it will take you right to the intersection of 142 & Trigger.  Trigger only has a handful of houses, and where the drive splits at a fork, there\u2019s the sign with a hand pointing to 10. Park either in front of the shed or behind the house under the outer carport slot.  The front door is unlocked for you!

Our other travel plans canceled for this year, we decided to stay fairly close to home with a roadtrip in Colorado and northern New Mexico, and found this lovely vacation home where we could easily adhere to social distancing requirements, and have a lovely vacation nonetheless. \r\nThe porch is a wonderful spot to spend some time reading or just staring at the big sky, especially around sunset.\r\nThe main living area of the home stayed nice and cool without even using the AC, just windows closed during the day, and open during the cool nights. \r\nThe kitchen is small, but provided everything we needed to prepare our own meals.\r\nTaking a shower surrounded by natural stones, under a skylight, is lovely.\r\nWi-Fi was strong, providing fast internet, despite being in a remote location.","comment_karma":"0","comment_approved":"1","comment_agent":"Mozilla\/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:79.0) Gecko\/20100101 Firefox\/79.0","comment_type":"comment","comment_parent":"0","user_id":"52182"},"214222":{"comment_ID":"214222","comment_post_ID":"407656","comment_author":"Kristen","comment_author_email":"kristen.e.hall@gmail.com","comment_author_url":"","comment_author_IP":"73.222.230.11","comment_date":"2019-12-26 08:01:07","comment_date_gmt":"2019-12-26 16:01:07","comment_content":"We spent eight days here in December and it was absolutely magical.

We enjoyed making meals in the small kitchen, and exploring the hills in the surrounding area with our dog. It was a great base for exploring Santa Fe, Taos, and Ghost Ranch, as well as all the history and beauty of the immediately surrounding area. Lynn was a fantastic host - very responsive and helpful.

From north, you'll hit Bodes before the turn off.)  From Bodes, turn left out of the parking lot, and go about 3.5 miles on 84 until you get to Rt 554.  (And obviously if you don\u2019t go to Bodes first, just turn right at 554 from 84). This intersection has Mamacita\u2019s Pizza on your left as you turn. Turn onto 554 (the only possible way).  Go about half a mile, over a bridge at the Chama River, and then make the very next possible right turn on Rt 142 after bridge. You\u2019ll drive through a little wash (dry) and go maybe 1\/2 mile more to Trigger Rd.  It\u2019s after Inez St, and Green Meadows Dr.  Turn left on Trigger (the only way).  The address is 10 Trigger Dr.  \r\n\r\nWhen you head down Trigger you'll pass a house on the right and then you'll  come to a large painted sign that says \"11 Trigger\" with an arrow pointing straight ahead.

You should be able to see the house from here. La Biblioteca is the farthest left of three structures. The middle and largest is the main house (Casa Tocaya), and on the right is an adobe shed.

Trigger has only a handful of houses, and where the drive splits at a fork, there\u2019s the sign with a hand pointing to 10. Park behind the guest house.

It's a special place. A hundred years ago this was a bucolic hunting and camping destination for Angelenos and there's a legacy from that time you can experience first hand. Only a handful of the lodges and cabins that once dotted the hills still survive. This one is a cozy piece of California heritage that will never go out of style.<\/p>\r\n<p>Nestled into a tranquil and private canyon setting, with drop dead gorgeous views of the Santa Monica mountains state park, this is the perfect little hideaway that takes you back in time with its vintage charms. Creatively and gracefully restored, the bright, cheerful interiors feature an artistic eye for detail and flow in a subtle mix of mountain and modern living that reminds us of why we love it here!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>So head up to our neck of the woods and cozy up to this cabin rental in Topanga.<\/p>"],"pool_exists":[null],"kid_friendly":["Yes"],"price_is_per_night":["Yes"],"net_checkbox":["Yes"],"available_for_rent_check":[null],"pool-BH":["No"],"country":["United States"],"prop-inv-name":["1925 Cabin"],"rates_table":["<div class=\"rates_table_overall_v2\">\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<h3>Rate Table<\/h3>\r\n\t\t<p>This is the area where some general basic info can be added above the actual rate table and it needs to have...<\/p>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t<table border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\r\n\t\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<th bgcolor=\"#339999\" style=\"border-color: #CCCCCC;
