Gallery at Abbey Hall is a unique and magical place to stay. This converted barn is an impressive space, with history in its stones. Especially now, when everyone is stuck inside, it gives an extraordinary sense of airiness and light, and the opportunity to feel liberated. A huge wood burning stove adds to the atmosphere and keeps the place warm, though there are also other heaters. The downstairs area offers really grand dining while upstairs is for relaxing. It's nice to be in the gallery surrounded by art - and the bedroom area is really cozy. The space has been cleverly converted so there are different areas - a lounge, a breakfast nook and a bedroom. There are - luxury - two loos and a great shower. The locality nearby is charming, a proper little town with great walks. It's not a conventional choice for bed and breakfast. Instead it's a place to inspire, somewhere wonderful to think, chill out, read, or work. We loved it!\r\n\r\nWriter & Art Critic","comment_karma":"0","comment_approved":"1","comment_agent":"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/86.0.4240.198 Safari\/537.36","comment_type":"comment","comment_parent":"0","user_id":"53698"}},"comment_meta":{"219017":{"rating":["5"],"city":["London "],"country":["United Kingdom"]}},"conversation_data":{"VJ1605270488":{"id":"77908","operator_id":"27524","user_name":"Simone","ticket_id":"VJ1605270488","email":"simone@boutique-homes.com","status_id":"6","dt":"2020-11-13 12:28:08","ip":"91.47.16.185","invoice_status":"","locked_by":"0","post_id":"584054","user_surname":"Schoene","accepted":"0","reserved":"0","booked":"0","booking_time":null,"reserveData":"a:15:{s:19:\"reserveClientGuests\";s:1:\"1\";s:17:\"reserveClientKids\";s:1:\"0\";s:22:\"reserveClientStartDate\";s:11:\"Jan 2, 2021\";s:20:\"reserveClientEndDate\";s:11:\"Jan 9, 2021\";s:19:\"reserveClientNights\";s:1:\"7\";s:18:\"reserveClientPhone\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"reserveRentalFees\";s:0:\"\";s:18:\"reserveClientEmail\";s:25:\"simone@boutique-homes.com\";s:21:\"reserveRentalCurrency\";s:0:\"\";s:19:\"reserveCleaningFees\";s:0:\"\";s:14:\"reservePetFees\";s:0:\"\";s:16:\"reserveOtherFees\";s:0:\"\";s:14:\"reserveTaxFees\";s:0:\"\";s:18:\"reserveDepositFees\";s:0:\"\";s:13:\"clientChanges\";s:2:\"no\";}","hidden":"0","confirmed":"0","reminder":null,"read":"1","last_message":"2020-11-13 13:50:34","follow_up":"a:1:{s:15:\"client_reminder\";s:0:\"\";}","client_2_reminder":null,"client_id":"24890","arrival_date":"1609545600","internal_notes":"","category":"1019","license":"License-Partner","archived":"0","to_check":"client","owner_read":"0","messages":{"287024":{"id":"287024","ticket_id":"VJ1605270488","message":"Congratulations!

We have worked for 10 years to establish a vibrant and unique space where we can live, work and create site-specific and one off events.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nAbbey Hall is on the site of the former Benedictine Priory of St Peter built in 1011. The former Abbey Farm Barn was Listed at Risk in 1974 and has been under the watchful eye of English Heritage and Suffolk Archaeology. The Barn was used as a working dairy, then livestock farm until falling into disuse, when we bought it and proposed the development of the house and reviving the \"Barn\" as an open space for events and exhibitions.\r\n\r\nWe worked with local builders James Newstead and Julian White to create the house and barn. For more than 5 years we worked together to form a unique understanding of what we wanted and what was achievable - and we are still friends!\r\n\r\nFollowing many years of careful navigation of heritage, archaeology and building control, we have successfully restored the buildings to create a unique place that breathes through 1000 years.\r\n\r\nSpace\r\n\r\nAbbey Hall is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and we have worked closely with English Heritage to repair and revive the original Bake and Brew house built in 1583.\r\n\r\nWe have respected the original building and materials and applied new ideas and techniques to create a mesmerizing mixture of old and new, which exudes the romantic values of the site and has a cool and modern sense of purpose.\r\nOur kitchen workshop is equipped with electrical, fire and water services and provides a flexible space for caterers to create their magical menus. We have an optional catering tent for gas cooking.\r\n\r\nEvents\r\n\r\nAbbey Hall is the perfect location for a special event - birthdays, weddings, dance, music, drama or just socialising.\r\n\r\nThe acoustic is excellent and we have hosted many intimate concerts with harpsichord, piano or reggae. Seating space is 85 and standing 120.\r\n\r\nSeating for dining is optimum 80-100, and we have a fantastic local caterer - Julie Abbs - who can work with us to staff, prepare and serve delicious food and wines. We also work with local hire companies for any special equipment or services required.\r\n\r\nWe have produced photoshoots, fashion shows, ballet festivals, music evenings, charity events, weddings and corporate functions and all have different and exciting challenges.\r\n\r\nTerence Blacker and Louis de Bernieres performing their hilarious double act in a candlelit Abbey Hall\r\n\r\nWeddings\r\n\r\nWeddings at Abbey Hall are always memorable. We have the space to create the mood you are looking for - from rural charm to rustic cool.\r\n\r\nThere is no limit to the imaginative format of your wedding:\r\nacross the meadows is our beautiful church, there is the historic castle and the Town Hall is licensed for civil weddings, or perhaps under the glorious oak tree behind the Hall.\r\n\r\nTogether with our favourite caterers, we can provide unique ingredients to make the day go to plan.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n\r\nAbbey Hall is situated on the site of a c11 Priory on the outskirts of the beautiful market town of Eye, Suffolk.\r\n\r\nSet in 10 acres of water meadows leading to the river Dove and beyond to the magnificent Church of St Peter and St Paul, the landscape is a tranquil example of the English Picturesque.\r\n\r\nWe are directly on the ancient Michael and Mary ley line, which runs from the Suffolk coast to Glastonbury and St Michael's Mount, so the spiritual peace is complemented by the most amazing sunsets.\r\n\r\nThe historic town of Eye is a thriving market town with a great pub, post office, bank, butchers and all the shops you need. There are lots of options for accommodation nearby and transport links are good for roads or rail. Diss is 3 miles away, with 1.5 hour links to London Liverpool Street. We are just off the A140 20 miles from both Ipswich and Norwich.\r\n"],"ms_facts_influencer":[null],"ms_facts_social":[null],"bhome_facts_other_sites":[null],"ms_facts_around":[null],"ms_facts_history":[null],"ms_facts_architect":[null],"ms_facts_press":[null],"ms_facts_seo":[null],"bhome_property_title":[[]],"ms_facts_exterior":[null],"ms_facts_interior":[null],"rates_table":["<div class=\"rates_table_overall_v2\">\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<h3>Rate Table<\/h3>\r\n\t\t<p>This is the area where some general basic info can be added above the actual rate table and it needs to have...<\/p>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t<table border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\r\n\t\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<th bgcolor=\"#339999\" style=\"border-color: #CCCCCC;
